        <p class="aboutp"> Hi! My name is Austin Randolph. I am a former culinary student and prep cook who is
            currently studying Full Stack Web Development at the UNH Coding Bootcamp. This is my first (sorta)
            functional website! I hope to modify and adapt this as I learn new techniques, and make it even more
            functional! The picture to the left of this paragraph is my dog, Harley. He likes to bark as loud as
            possible while I'm trying to code.</p><br>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my site! If you click on the "Contact" or "Portfolio" links on the top right of this
            page, it will take you to a currently nonfunctional page. Don't let that stop you though! Please click on
            them and have a look at the other pages (I worked really hard on them!). Please enjoy your time here, and
            please, direct any complaints to my complaints department (aka Harley)! </p>
